# JST-PIT-analysis
Own package for analyzing PIT data for Polish JSTs

There are 3 types of JSTs (local government units) in Poland:
* wojew√≥dztwa (voivodeships)
* powiaty (land counties) and miasta na prawach powiatu (city counties)
* gminy

This pip installable package, based on pandas library, provides tools to prepare, compare and visualize government data about PIT tax income for each JST. It also combines PIT with population data. The package's features are presented in an analysis of data from 2019 and 2020 (in Polish).

What I learned:
* building and testing a custom package
* using Excel data in Python
* dealing with data inconsistencies and errors
* creating readable visualizations
